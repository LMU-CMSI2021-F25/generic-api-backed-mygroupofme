I didn't use much AI for this project. 

The more I learn, the more I find it ineffective. If I'm struggling with/forgetting something, I would rather go to resources like Stack Overflow, or if I want ChatGPT to make me larger chunks of code, they never work, and since I didn't write it, I have no way to debug. 

The times I did use it were:
- I attempted to have it figure out how to make the visibility of the button toggle since there was not a lot of good information on Google, and it helped a little.
- I had it write code after I lost it all, but I checked it against my memory of the code and just used it to copy and paste and save myself from redoing work.
