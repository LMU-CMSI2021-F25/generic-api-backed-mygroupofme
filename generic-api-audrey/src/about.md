This app provides data about the user's choice of 4 different planets from Star Wars that I chose based on their prevalence in the franchise and their visual uniqueness. The data comes from https://swapi.dev/ and has a lot more information about each planet, but I stuck to what you would get in a tourist brochure, so it doesn't look crowded. The user requests information about each planet by clicking on an invisible button on the image of each planet. 

This functionality could be used as an interactive way to learn or as a quiz to see if the user can guess facts about a planet before clicking to reveal.
